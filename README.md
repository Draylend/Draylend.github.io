A Passion Project on making my first video game.

This project was created in 2022 and involves using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a simple memory game that utilizes pressing buttons. You are shown an order of random buttons being pressed. After, you must recreate the order of buttons pressed to move onto the next round. As you progress, more buttons will be added with a different order everytime. There are power-ups available in the shop to help make gameplay more interesting and exciting.
